# TEST DRIVE A SINGLE-METHOD PROGRAM

----

## Objective

To learn how to test-drive a single-method program by focusing on the 'Create Examples as Tests' and 'Implement behaviour' steps first.

simplified steps to a test-driven development:

1. Writing one simple test at a time to see that it fails with an error('red' phase)

2. Then writing just enough of the program so that it can behave like the example test written and for it to pass when the test is run again('green' phase)

3. Then if necessary, improving the readability, structure and other qualities of the code without changing its behaviour('refactor' phase)

4. Then repeat step 1 to 3 with anoter small example, until the program is complete and have written a full set of examples to prove it.
